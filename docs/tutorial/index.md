# xHIS Widget Tutorial

## What is xHIS Widget

An xHIS Widget is a user-facing module which displays information and provides a specific way for users to interact with xHIS. We use widgets to modularize the main functional elements of xHIS. For example, the Login Widget is in charge of the login process, and the Drug Widget helps doctors prescribe drugs.

## xUI

xUI is the core UI component framework designed to implement xHIS widgets. It builds on top of Vue 3. Most of the xUI functionality is developed and maintained by AICS. Use xUI components to implement widgets as possible as you can. No need to reinvent the wheel. A widget developer should use xUI color and typography system for UI consistency and easier maintenance.

## The goal of the tutorial

The goal of the tutorial is to make a frontend developer familiar with xUI & widget development framework, and be able to implement an xHIS user-facing module with consistent visual design, customizability, and rule checking capability.
